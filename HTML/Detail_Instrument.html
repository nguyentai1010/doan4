        <p>Standard: </p>

          <p>In standard tuning, the C-major chord has three shapes because of the irregular major-third between the G- and B-strings.
          By the 16th century, the guitar tuning of ADGBE had already been adopted in Western culture; a lower E was later added on the bottom as a sixth string.[32] The result, known as "standard tuning", has the strings tuned from a low E, to a high E, traversing a two-octave rangeâ€”EADGBE. This tuning is a series of ascending fourths (and a single major third) from low to high.[32] The reason for ascending fourths is to accommodate four fingers on four frets up a scale before moving to the next string. This is musically convenient and physically comfortable and it eased the transition between fingering chords and playing scales.[32] If the tuning contained all perfect fourths, the range would end up being two octaves plus one semitone;[33] the high string would be an F, a dissonant half-step from the low E and much out of place.[32][33]

          The pitches are as follows </p>


        <h2>GUITAR HISTORY </h2>
        <p> From a young age, she began to love country music. Developed by Taylor Swift</p>
        <p>The guitar has a long history, probably starting with the bowstrings of ancient hunters. The snap of the bowstring when the arrow was launched suggested the ancients to create the lyre, harp, and lutz. These guitars are made from wood, tortoise shells and animal tendons. In Greece in the 7th century, the lyre and the cithara appeared popular (a large, bulky instrument, mimicking the structure of a lyre with a large wooden top).

          The word "guitar" is derived from the word cithara. The first guitar probably appeared in Egypt and Babylon from 1000 BC. Through many transformations, it was brought to Europe by invading armies around the 8th century and flourished in the 14th century, especially in Spain. It is not known when the word guitarra appeared in Spain. However, during the 14th century, there were two types of instruments called guittara, the Latina guittara and the Morisca guittara, that occupied the unique throne in the country of the bulls.</p>
        <h2>CLASSIFY</h2>
        <p>Along with the development of time, along with the inevitable changes of society, ideology, and human consciousness, the guitar also has significant changes.

          In terms of music genre, guitars are divided into two mainstream lines: classical guitar and light music guitar. Classical guitars are usually wooden, with 6 strings, sometimes designed as 12 strings. In light music, there are richer genres, so people also divide guitars into lines such as flamenco guitar, jazz or rock guitar.

          In terms of structure, guitars are divided into electric guitars, Hawaiian guitars, concave guitars, accompaniment guitars (bass), two-arm guitars, 4-stringed, 7-stringed, 12-stringed guitars. But normally guitars are divided into two large groups: acoustic guitars and electric guitars.</p>
